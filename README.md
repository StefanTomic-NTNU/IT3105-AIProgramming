# IT3105-AIProgramming
IT3105 - Artificial Intelligence Programming at NTNU. Spring 2022. Conatins various projects in Reinforcement Learning, capable of solving various simworlds

1. General Purpose RL system based on the SARSA algotithm for learning Markov Decision Process policy.
   - Represents an improvement over Q-learning
   - Able to solve simple challenges such as Tower of Hanoi, cart pole balancing and Nim
2. RL system utilizing a Actor/Critic networks in conjunction with **Monte Carlo Tree Search**, similar to _AlphaGo_
   - Capable of achieving remarkable results in the boardgame Hex
3. Group project iterating on previous RL system, able to control a simulated Acrobat
